<h1> My Programming Journey </h1>
<p><font size = +2>
I am coding since the age of 10. I love coding,it is my passion and would be probably majoring in CS.At first I thought that programming
I thought is just like another playing toy.I got my first laptop which was a HP at the age of 8-9 years old.I spent my 2 years figuring out how does this 
laptop work.I learned MS word,MS excel,MS powerpoint and database.Then I learned programming at age of 10 by starting with scratch.Then I learned HTML which I have again
learn at school next year.Then at 8th,I have learned a bit visual basic which was again from school but it was very boring.So I learned Java and Javascript which was a bit
complicated but I get over it.Then at around October I starting learning python and finished it at November.I took a course of web developement with python and CSS.
At GCI 2019, I learned creating free webs with github with Jboss organization.So I decided I should create my own website too.So here am I.
